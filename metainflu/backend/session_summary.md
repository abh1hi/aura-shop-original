# Session Summary - October 2, 2025, 

## Summary

The goal of this session was to simplify the backend user model to support only a single "client" user type. This involved removing all other user types (`admin`, `influencer`, `b2b`, `c2c`) and their related files and logic.

Following the backend simplification, the frontend files were analyzed to identify the required data models. Based on this analysis, new models, routes, and controllers were created for `Product`, `Category`, `Order`, and `Cart`. Obsolete files related to the old `Campaign` and `Payment` models were also removed.
