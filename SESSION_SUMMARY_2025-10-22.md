# Session Summary - 2025-10-22

## Objective

The main objective of this session was to integrate Capacitor into the `client-app` to enable its conversion into a native Android application.

## Work Done

1.  **Added Capacitor to `client-app`**:
    *   Installed Capacitor core and CLI dependencies (`@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/cli`).
    *   Initialized a new Capacitor project within the `metainflu/frontend/client-app` directory.
        *   App Name: "Aura Shop"
        *   App ID: "com.aurashop.app"
        *   Web Directory: "dist"
    *   Added the Android platform to the Capacitor project.

2.  **Created Android Build Guide**:
    *   A new file, `CAPACITOR_ANDROID_GUIDE.md`, was created in the `metainflu/frontend/client-app` directory.
    *   This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to build the Vue.js application, sync it with the Android project, and run it in Android Studio.

## Next Steps

*   Follow the `CAPACITOR_ANDROID_GUIDE.md` to build and test the Android application.
*   Begin development of native-specific features if required.
