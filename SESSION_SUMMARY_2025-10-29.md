## 1. New Feature: Hierarchical Product Categories

To improve performance and data organization, a three-level category system was implemented.

### Backend Implementation (Phases 1, 2, 3)

- **Data Model Updates:**
  - A new model, `SubCategory`, was created (`models/SubCategory.js`) to represent the third level of the hierarchy (e.g., "Tops", "Trousers").
  - The `Category` model (`models/Category.js`) was corrected to ensure its `parentCategory` field properly references the `ParentCategory` model.
  - The `Product` model (`models/Product.js`) was updated to include three new fields for storing the entire category chain: `parentCategory`, `category`, and `subCategory`.

- **Sub-Category API:**
  - A full suite of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints was created for managing sub-categories.
  - New files `controllers/subCategoryController.js` and `routes/subCategoryRoutes.js` were created.
  - The new routes were registered in `server.js` under the `/api/subcategories` path, with write-access restricted to admins.

- **Product Endpoint Enhancements:**
  - The main product controller (`controllers/productController.js`) was significantly refactored.
  - The `getProducts` and `getProductsAdmin` functions now support filtering products by `parentCategory`, `category`, or `subCategory` via query parameters.
  - The `createProduct` and `updateProduct` functions were updated to accept and save the new three-level category references.

### Frontend Implementation

- **Product Edit Form:**
  - The `ProductEdit.vue` page was enhanced to include three chained (dependent) dropdown menus.
  - This allows an administrator to select a `ParentCategory`, which then populates the `Category` dropdown, which in turn populates the `SubCategory` dropdown, ensuring a valid hierarchy is assigned to each product.

## 2. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were identified and resolved during the session.

### Backend: `TypeError: argument handler must be a function`

- **Problem:** The backend server was crashing on startup due to an error in `productRoutes.js`.
- **Root Cause:** A previous refactoring of `productController.js` had inadvertently removed the `module.exports` statement. This caused the `require` call in the routes file to receive an empty object, making the controller functions `undefined`.
- **Solution:** The `module.exports` block was correctly added back to the end of `productController.js`, resolving the crash.

### Frontend: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')`

- **Problem:** The `Dashboard` and `Orders` pages were crashing during render.
- **Root Cause:** The application was attempting to call the `.toFixed(2)` method on a price value (`totalRevenue` or `totalPrice`) before the data was loaded from the API, resulting in an error.
- **Solution:** The templates for `Dashboard.vue` and `Orders.vue` were made more robust by providing a default value of `0` for the price fields (e.g., `(stats.totalRevenue || 0).toFixed(2)`). This ensures that even if the data is not yet present, the render function does not fail.

This concludes the summary of the session. The new category system is now implemented from a code perspective, with the final step being a data migration script (as discussed in the plan) to update existing products.
